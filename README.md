#üìò Cybrary ‚Äî SOC Analyst L1

Short description:
A practical roadmap and lab-driven collection to learn the fundamentals required for a Security Operations Center (SOC) Level 1 analyst role ‚Äî built to mirror Cybrary's SOC-L1 style content: log monitoring, triage, basic incident response, and SIEM fundamentals.

#üéØ Learning Objectives

Understand SOC roles & shift handoffs (L1 responsibilities).

Read and interpret common security logs (Windows, Linux, firewall, proxy).

Use a SIEM for alert investigation and triage.

Apply basic threat-hunting queries and create simple detection rules.

Perform initial containment & escalate to L2/L3 with high-quality incident notes.

Familiarity with common tools: Splunk/ELK, Wireshark, Sysinternals, basic Python/PowerShell for triage.

üß≠ Who this is for

Beginners seeking SOC L1 role.

Students converting Cybrary course concepts into hands-on labs and a portfolio.

Entry-level cybersecurity job hunters who want practical artifacts to show in interviews.

üîÅ Prerequisites

Basic OS knowledge: Windows & Linux command line.

Networking fundamentals: TCP/IP, DNS, common ports.

Comfortable reading logs and following step-by-step technical instructions.

üóÇÔ∏è Suggested Module / Syllabus (module ‚Üí topics & lab ideas)

Intro to SOC & L1

Role/responsibilities, shift model, playbooks.

Lab: Write a mock shift handover template.

Log Sources & Formats

Windows Event Logs, Syslog, Firewall logs, Proxy logs.

Lab: Collect Windows event logs; parse Security/EVENT IDs.

SIEM Fundamentals

Ingest, normalization, correlation, dashboards, alerts.

Lab: Set up a basic ELK or Splunk Free trial; ingest sample logs and build a dashboard.

Alert Triage & Investigation

False positives vs real incidents, TTP mapping, IOC enrichment.

Lab: Walkthrough triage of a phishing alert; document steps.

Network Traffic Basics

Packet capture, common protocols, detecting anomalies.

Lab: Capture pcap in Wireshark; identify suspicious traffic.

Endpoint Triage

Basic host forensics, process listing, scheduled tasks, autoruns.

Lab: Use Sysinternals (Process Explorer) output on a Windows VM.

Threat Intelligence & Enrichment

IOC lookup, reputation services, enrichment automation.

Lab: Automate enrichment using simple scripts or manual TI lookup.

Incident Handling & Escalation

Playbooks, containment basics, preserving evidence.

Lab: Create an incident ticket with timeline, evidence list, suggested containment.

Reporting & Communication

Writing concise incident notes; lessons learned.

Lab: Draft an L1->L2 escalation document for a ransomware-like indicator.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies to learn

SIEM: Splunk (free), Elastic Stack (ELK).

Log collection: Winlogbeat, Filebeat, nxlog.

Packet capture: Wireshark, tcpdump.

Host triage: Sysinternals Suite (Windows), lsof/ss/top (Linux).

Scripts: Basic Python & PowerShell for log parsing and automation.

Threat intel: VirusTotal, OTX, AbuseIPDB.

üß™ Hands-on lab ideas & sample exercises

Build a mini-SIEM: ingest Windows Security logs ‚Üí write a rule to detect failed RDP brute-force.

Create a phishing-analysis playbook: identify sender, check headers, extract URLs, and mark malicious.

pcap triage: find C2 beacons (periodic small packets), map to process using timestamps.

Host triage checklist: list processes, open sockets, scheduled tasks, recent file changes, registry autoruns.

‚úÖ L1 Daily Playbook (quick checklist)

Review overnight/high-priority alerts.

Triage & enrich (IPs, domains, hashes).

Run quick host checks or request snapshots.

Contain if necessary (isolate host) per playbook.

Escalate with clear evidence & timeline.

Document action taken & update dashboards.

üíº Typical SOC L1 job responsibilities

Monitor alerts from SIEM & other detection systems.

Perform initial triage and evidence collection.

Escalate validated incidents to L2/L3 with relevant artifacts.

Follow runbooks & playbooks; update documentation.

Maintain and tune basic detection rules under supervision.

üìù Sample resume bullets (SOC L1)

Triage and investigated 50+ daily SIEM alerts, reducing false positives by 30% via rule tuning.

Performed host and network triage using Sysinternals and Wireshark; documented findings in the SIEM ticketing system.

Created onboarding playbooks for new analysts, improving response consistency.

‚ùì Common interview questions (and how to answer briefly)

Q: How do you triage a phishing alert?
A: Verify headers, check link reputation, isolate user if credentials compromised, collect email artifacts, escalate if malicious.

Q: What‚Äôs your first step if a host shows ransomware indicators?
A: Isolate host from network, preserve memory/disk if possible, capture key logs and escalate immediately.

Q: How do you reduce false positives?
A: Tune detection thresholds, normalize logs correctly, add contextual enrichment (asset tags, business criticality).
